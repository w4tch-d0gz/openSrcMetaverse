# openSrcMetaverse
This is a custom and open source metaverse, I want this project to grow and become as big as possible so a company like Meta (Facebook) doesn't monotize something that is so trivial but almost a right to have, This will not have any data collection except for things like in-game data, usernames, and passwords.
