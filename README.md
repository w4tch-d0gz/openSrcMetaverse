# Open Source Metaverse
This is a custom and open source metaverse, I want this project to grow and become as big as possible so a company like Meta (Facebook) doesn't monotize something that is so trivial but almost a right to have, This will not have any data collection except for things like in-game data, usernames, and passwords.

## Installation

Coming soon!

## Features
* No data collection except for what is necessary
* everything in game will be free (A donation feature will be availiable)
* support for as many V.R. headsets as possible
* In game items include Cars, games (e.g. PingPong), avatars, pets, homes, etc.

## Rules for contributing
* ABSOLUTLEY NO UNNECESSARY DATA COLLECTION
* No malicious commits
* You MAY NOT make a fork of OpenSrcMetaverse with the intention of making a monetary gain
